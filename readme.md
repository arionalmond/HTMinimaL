## Learn/Teach
[back to contents](#contents)  
Learning and Teaching at the same time. 
A good process for this is to use the scientific method

Question - What - Can I simplify usage of FE Framework?
Research - Why - Don't just use a framework because you're told to, understand why.

Hypothesis - How -  
    Plain html and javascript projects have pain points.  
    I extract the needed pieces of a framework into simple library.

Experiment - Where -  
    Create a test site, plain html, css, javascript. Incorporate some common features of modern sites.  
    What can I do? Not do? What hard? What is getting repeated? (Nav, Component, Common Page Template, Small changes needed in many places)

Conclusion - When -  
Already finding some things that improvement or are solved by frameworks. This could be my limited HTML/CSS/JS knowledge/experience.   

1. Keeping consistency between pages. Basically, since this isn't a SPA but has multiple views(pages) I'm having to repeat HTML from base page to all other pages. Components or templates probably solve this. Checking if HTML has a better process for this or CSS or JS does??
2. Navigation Links - router/routing in frameworks
3. Small changes to "the template" have to be repeated on all pages.
